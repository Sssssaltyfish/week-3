# Rubbish

A catastrophic failure of scraper and django-based web application. Wish I won't get \*\*ed by D\*\*ban's department of legal affairs.

## Run Server

Make sure you have django-3.1 installed & activated (possibly in a virtual environment using Anaconda or so), then execute `server/manage.py` in command line.

> The scraper part is not essential for running the server. It's here as part of **HUGE homework** requirement only. The user shall take full responsibility of any usage under any circunstances.
